# SC Fundamentals

This repository contains **Computer Science fundamentals**, focused on preparing for **backend internship live-coding interviews**.

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving**, using **Java**, organizing concepts from the ground up.

---

## Project Structure & Topics

### Control Structures & Basics

* Variables and data types
* Conditionals: If-Else and Switch logic.
* Loops: ForEach, While, and Do-While implementations.)
* Functions / methods
* Recursion (basic understanding)

### Data Structures

* 1D arrays
* 2D arrays (matrices)
* Traversing arrays
* Finding min / max
* Sorting arrays
* Arrays vs ArrayList

### Searching Algorithms

* Linear Search
* Binary Search

### Algorithms & Patterns

* Searching: Linear Search and Binary Search.
* Sorting: Common sorting algorithm implementations.
* Optimization Patterns: Two Pointers technique.
* Divide and Conquer (concept)
* Traversals
* Edge cases
* Input validation

### Graph Basics

* Graph fundamentals
* Adjacency list representation
* BFS (Breadth First Search)
* DFS (Depth First Search)

### Problem-Solving Methodology

* Local Thinking: Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks.
* Robustness: Handling edge cases and input validation.
* Analysis: Complexity (Big O notation) fundamentals.

### Memory Management & OOP

* Memory: Understanding Stack vs. Heap, and passing variables by value vs. reference.
* Concurrency: Differences between Concurrency and Parallelism.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
    *Abstraction & Encapsulation.
    *Inheritance & Polymorphism.

## Technologies

* **Java**
* **VS Code**
* **Git & GitHub**

---

## Purpose

This repository is meant to:

* Strengthen CS fundamentals for backend roles
* Practice common interview patterns
* Prepare for **backend internship live-coding sessions**

---

## How to Run

Each .java file is a standalone example of a concept. You can run them directly:

# Compile
javac path/to/FileName.java

# Run
java path/to/FileName

Or run directly using VS Code Java extensions.

---

## Notes

* The focus is on **clarity and understanding**, not micro-optimizations
* Each topic is implemented with simple, readable examples
